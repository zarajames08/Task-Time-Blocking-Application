# TaskFrame

TaskFrame is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. The app allows users to organise and manage their tasks efficiently to boost productivity. 

Users will input their tasks and the estimated completion time and the app will automatically group tasks based on keywords, caculating the total time users will need to spend per category. This helps to break down long and stressful workloads into manageable frames, encouraging users to use the time blocking method. 

Features of the application:
- Task Categorisation automatically groups task into Work, Personal or University categories based on keywords inputted during task entry
- Colour Coding for each category enhances the user interface
- Total Time displayed within each category shows users how much time it will take to complete each group
- Scrollable Interface allows users to view all task groups when lists extend beyond the middle frame
- Buttons for adding tasks, deleting selected groups or clearing all allows users to manage their list

Language and Libraries used:
- Python 3.13.7 as the coding language
- Tkinter as the library to build the apps user interface
